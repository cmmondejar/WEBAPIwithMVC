How to run application

1. open the webapplication8(api) in visual studio then run (note : run this appllication first) - dont stop keep this running cause MVC will get error.

2. open the MVCCore in visual studio then run, after you run you have access the app(login, add, edit and delete ) explore my created application feature :)

Thank you !
